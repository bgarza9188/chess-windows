# chess-windows
Virtual Chess board built in Love2D. To run this you'll need a windows machine that has LOVE installed on it. See link: https://www.love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started As well as all files need to be in the same directory. There is no save state built yet, so once the app is closed the board will be reset upon launching again.
